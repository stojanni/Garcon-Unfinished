***An ordering app to replace waiters***

My original plan was to conctact local premise owners, convinse them to use this app with a very low cost and eventually expand. Stripe was intended as a payment gateway. I originaly made this project with Flutter, remade it in React Native and settled in classic Android. The design was structured in a way that enabled the use of the service both by owners and clients in the same app and device.
